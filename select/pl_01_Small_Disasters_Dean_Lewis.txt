Rest my head against the wall
Waiting for a call
that never came
'Cause time moves so slowly
when you're still holding
onto blame
I tried but can't forget the day
You were reaching for my hand
as I touched your face
When your secrets were
still safe from me
Till your eyes gave you away
'Cause we are drowning
Above the water
In a movie drained of colour
Luckless lovers
With a past that's just a string
of small disasters
I'd give it all just
to feel something real
And now I see the warning signs
With the benefit of hindsight
I was blind
To the way you'd make me
feel so crazy
Just to protect your lies
And all I wanted was the truth
The better part of you
that I still see
'Cause love is
all we have to give
But you took my best for free
'Cause we are drowning
Above the water
In a movie drained of colour
Luckless lovers
With a past that's just a string
of small disasters
I'd give it all just
to feel something real
And the one thing
that really hurts is
We were so close
to being perfect
And I know you'll be okay
And that's what kills me, yeah
'Cause we are drowning
Above the water
In a movie drained of colour
Luckless lovers
With a past that's just a string
of small disasters
'Cause we are drowning
Above the water
In a movie drained of colour
Luckless lovers
With a past that's just a string
of small disasters
I'd give it all just
to feel something real
(Something real)
Oh, I'd give it all just
to feel something real
